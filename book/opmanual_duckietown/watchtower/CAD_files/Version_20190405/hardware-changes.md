# Hardware changes made to this version {#part:watchtowers-hardware-changes status=beta}

The following changes have been made with respect to the version from 2018-07-25

* _19_rpi_case_groundplate_: The mounting holes of the RPi were moved next to the tower. The RPi is now better accessible for the airflow of the fan.
* _20_watchtower_groundplate_: Holes in groundplate, because there must be some space for the screws holding the Raspberry Pi in order to lie perfectly flat.
* _17_case_front_: The front is now closed more because the air flow must be guided only through the RPi â†’ only some space for powering the RPi is left.
* _18_case_sides_: Some minor changes in the design.
* _16_case_back_: The backside is closed because the air flow must be guided only through the RPi
* _20_watchtower_groundplate_: Adjusted the mounting holes for the three parts of the tower to ensure that there is only one way to put them in as they all look quite similar.
* _04_tubeholder2_sides_: Adjusted the mounting into the part _20_watchtower_groundplate_ so that it looks different from the other three in order to ensure that there is only one way to put it in.
* _14_rpi_case_side_fan_: Newly defined part because the mounting of the fan needs a separate side wall.
* _15_rpi_case_top_: Introduced an interface for mounting the RGB (The RGB-sensor needs to be mounted as far away from the tower to not interfere with its shadow).
