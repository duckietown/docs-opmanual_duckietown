# Assembly {#part:dt-ops-assembly status=ready}

To assemble a Duckietown, follow this workflow:

* [Appearance specifications](#dt-ops-appearance-specifications): Make sure you have not skipped the preliminaries section and are familiar with the design rules of Duckietown.

* [Design](#dt-ops-appearance-specifications): Design a map according to the appearance specifications. If you are enrolled in the [Self-Driving cars with Duckietown](https://www.edx.org/course/self-driving-cars-with-duckietown) massive open online course (MOOC) you will need a map as in [](#fig:mooc-map).
